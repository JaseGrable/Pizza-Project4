## Description

- This is a website that I built for my coding bootcamp at Epicodus. The goal of the project is to use Object-Oriented-Programming to build a pizza order form. The order form allows for the choice of one or more toppings, the choice of a size, and an output of the final cost based on these choices. The website was built with test driven development practice and separation of business and user logic.
